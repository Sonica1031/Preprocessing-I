      <h2 ID = 'Skills'>My Skills</h2>
      <p>I have extensive skills in customer service
         and cash handling from years as a cashier.
          I have basic knowledge of HTML5, CSS and 
          I'm curently a student at Lambda School for full
          stack web development. I was over-nights as a pharmacy
          technician and have amazing time management skills, but over all
          my biggest skill is my ability to roll with the punches.</p>

    <div class = 'box'>
      <h2 ID = 'Goals'>My Goals</h2>
      <p>My long term goals are that I want to make my own games.
        I love designing things and I've been an avid gamer my entire
        life, so working on them would be a dream come true. I also want
        to continue growing and to have a career that allows me to continue
        to grow in everything that I do.
